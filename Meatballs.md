# Meatballs

- serves 4
- 45 mins prep
- ~4 hour cooking time

## ingredients

- 400g spaghetti
- 2 tins chopped tomatoes
- 2 large onions
- 2 medium eggs
- 375g beef mince
- 150g pork mince
- 2 bread slices
- cheddar cheese
- fresh mozzarella
- sugar, salt, and pepper
- basil
- oregano

## sauce (start around mid-day)

1. peel two large onions and blend 
2. add onion paste to the largest sauté pan you have with a splash of oil
3. sauté gently until the onion goes translucent (not brown!)
4. blend 2 tins chopped tomatoes and stir into the pan
5. leave cooking on the lowest heat for 3-4 hours

## prep meatballs

1. cut the fresh mozzarella into about 15 2cm sized cubes
2. toast two slices of bread, then blend
3. mix together the pork mince, beef mince, and breadcrumbs
4. add salt and pepper
5. add basil and oregano
6. add two eggs, and mix together by hand
7. take a handful of the mince mix, and roll into a ball just under 2" wide
8. press your thumb into the meatball to make a divot, and place a mozzarella cube inside
9. pinch the meatball closed to seal the mozzarella secret inside, and place to the side
10. repeat until you've used up all the mince mix!

## cook 

1. add 1/4 pint of milk to the sauce, and stir
2. add sugar to the sauce to taste
3. gently place each of the meatballs in the sauce, like they're swimming!
4. leave with the lid on for about 20 minutes (you may need to turn the heat up to bring it back to a bubble)
5. GENTLY roll the meatballs over - they should have browned and shrunk slightly
6. leave with the lid on another 15 minutes, then remove the lid
10. bring a pot of water to boil and add spaghetti
11. cook the spaghetti for ~11 minutes, then strain and serve!

## serve

serve 3-4 meatballs each atop the spaghetti, with grated cheddar and as much sauce from the pan as you like!

### enjoy! ^_^
