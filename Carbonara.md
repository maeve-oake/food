- 20 mins

## ingredients

- 400g spaghetti
- 6 medium eggs
- 1 block parmesan cheese

2. add four egg yolks
3. add two eggs
4. mix until thick. add spare egg white if needed

## cook

1. boil the pasta

3. when the spaghetti is ready, strain it off but keep the water
4. add the spaghetti back to the hot pan
5. add two ladels of spaghetti water
6. add the panchetta and egg & cheese mix
7. keep mixing with a spoon until the mix goes thick.

### **serve immediately!**
if you leave it too long, it will curdle and go sticky

- add pepper and a little parmesan

### enjoy! ^_^
