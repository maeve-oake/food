- serves 1
- 5 mins

## ingredients

- 1 tortilla
- 2 small eggs
- sliced ham / salami
- grated cheddar cheese
- mushrooms
- condiment of your choice (i like sweet chilli!)
- cooking oil

## prep

1. crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk
2. shred the ham or salami into small chunks
3. dice the mushrooms

## cook

1. in a frying pan about the same size as your tortillas, add some cooking oil
2. on a medium-low heat, fry off the mushrooms until golden brown
3. without removing the mushrooms, add the ham and fry until browned
4. using a wooden spoon, spread out the toppings evenly in the pan
5. pour your egg into the pan, ensuring it covers all of the toppings
6. before the egg cooks, sprinkle the grated cheese over the top
7. now add your tortilla - press it down so the melted cheese & runny egg sticks
8. cook the wrap for a few minutes, using a spatula to loosen and check underneath. it should be slightly browned on the bottom
9. flip the entire pan upside down over a plate, he whole wrap should fall out cleanly in once piece!

## serve

with a condiment of your choice. hot sauce, sweet chilli or ketchup work very well, then roll up tightly!

### enjoy ^_^
