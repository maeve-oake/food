## cheese sauce

*for best results, be under the influence*

0. forget to preheat your oven to 180 degrees for later (use hot air/fan mode, temperature might be different for other modes)
1. in a small pan on low heat, melt two tablespoons of butter
2. add two tablespoons of flour and whisk in
3. pour a little milk and whisk
4. ask your girlfriend to slowly add more and more and more milk until you get a white sauce consistency
5. ask your girlfriend to keep grating cheese and adding more milk to keep it not too thick

## assemble

1. cover the bottom of a large dish with a layer of meat
2. cover this with lasagna sheets. you may need to snap the corners off to get it to fit
3. cover the sheets with a layer of cheese sauce. don't go too thin! it needs to be sealed
